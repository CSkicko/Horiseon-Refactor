  I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
  SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
  
### Outcome:
  The client's code has been refactored to:
  - Utilise semantic HTML elements
  - Apply alt attributes to images and icons
  - Restructure HTML and CSS files to flow in a logical manner
  - Assign an appropriate title element
  - Consolidate and comment HTML files to ensure readability

### The code presented in this repository is deemed to satisfy the following acceptance criteria:
  GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
  WHEN I view the source code
  THEN I find semantic HTML elements
  WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
  THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
  WHEN I view the icon and image elements
  THEN I find accessible alt attributes
  WHEN I view the heading attributes
  THEN they fall in sequential order
  WHEN I view the title element
  THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
